To install this tool , you need to copy two files in your executable path (ftpbckp.exp and tree ).

3 - Features :

- Organization :

here is the situation ; you have an ftp account , and you want to use it to backup your important files .
the ftpbckp organises your backup in the ftp server as follows : it will create a folder named backup , 
in this folder it will create one backup folder per each folder you backup ,
these folders will be used to store the backups , in the way you have history of your backups ,
this is an example showing how it works : 
 

you have 3 folders in your machine called fold1 fold2 fold3 ,
one you used for the first time ftpbckp to backup fold1 ,
lets suppose you did it at this date 20/01/2004 at 20:35:43 ,
then you will have this tree in your ftp account :

- backup
    |
    |____ fold1
	    |
 	    |____fold120012004203543



then you used ftpbackup to backup the same folder 3 days later at this date 
23/01/2004 23:43:54
then the tree will be  :


- backup
    |
    |____ fold1
	    |
 	    |____fold120012004203543
	    |
 	    |____fold120012004234354


then u backed up fold2
		 

- backup
    |
    |____ fold1
    |	    |
    |	    |____fold120012004203543
    |	    |
    |	    |____fold120012004234354
    |
    |____ fold2
	    |
 	    |____fold212022004124323

- Tree copy :

when you backup a folder , the ftpbckp copies all the tree of the local folder to the ftp account file system , 
you dont have to make it plane before backup.





4 - Command Line :

To use this utility , first open a unix console on your system ,

then type : ftpbckp.exp folder ftpsrv login pass

all arguments are obligatory and this is their explanation :

folder : the path to the folder you want to backup 
	 all path formats are supported ex : /home/me/myfolder or
	./me/myfolder

ftpsrv : this is the hostname or ip adress where you have an ftp account ,
	 ex : ftp.ifrance.com , it could also be an ip adress.

login  : the login for authentification required by the ftp server.

pass   : the authentification password of your account.
